### Setting The Clock
After you're done creating and uploading your teams to your organisation, you need to tell **SalesProxy** your work timings. This helps it monitor your team without having to ask you every single day whether or not you're working that day. Just set it and forget it stuff.

#### How To Set Up Your Work Timings

- **[Login](https://manager.fieldproxy.com/login)** to Fieldproxy.
- On the left panel of the app, you can find **Settings** as an option. Click on it.

- Once in, you will be able to see the default work timings logged in for your organisation. To Change it, click on **Edit** on the top right section of the view.
- In the Edit option you can select the work timings for your organisation. Go crazy.

**Note:** These settings that you set for the work timings will be taken in by **SalesProxy** as the stipulated Check-in and Check-out times. So every employee in the organisation will be weighed in on these times.

If you have any further questions on timings or if you face any issues, you can always **[write to us here.](mailto:support@fieldproxy.com)**

Hope this helped.
