## Understanding The Dashboard

SalesProxy has a lot going on with its real-time interactive dashboard. It has several interactive elements spread accross the board.

Let's take a look at each of these little elements that make up the **[SalesProxy](https://fieldproxy.com/sales-proxy.html)** dashboard.

### Quick Overview

The Quick Overview panel displays the core metrics of the sales portal in the form of clickable cards. It shows you the number of new customers recorded for the day, the number of visits performed by your employees, and the number of employees on the field at any given time of the day.

Clicking on either card will show a popup of the data collected in a detailed excel sheet.

You can click on the eport icon to take an excel export of the data your team have collected.
