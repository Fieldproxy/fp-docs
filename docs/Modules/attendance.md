### Managing Your Employees' Timesheets Just Became A Whole Lot Easier

Imagine this - what if you had an attendance management solution for **tracking all your employees**, monitoring who was late when, who's been absent for a long time, and who's been one of the most punctual employees your team has ever had? Sounds too good to be true? 

Hereâ€™s how Attendance Proxy can help you:

- Increased efficiency

- Reduced costs

- Increased control over employee activity

- Greater focus

### Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

### Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times

### Custom id headers {#custom-id}

With `{#custom-id}` syntax you can set your own header id.
