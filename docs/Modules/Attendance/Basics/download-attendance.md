## Save Data To Your Local 

Downloading your team's attendance records is as easy as clicking a button. Literally.

- Login to **[Fieldproxy](https://client.fieldproxy.com/)**
- In the Dashboard view that appears, you can find the Attendance section, with the interactive charts and the curated table, filled with data from the current day.

- Here, you can just filter the data as required, by simply click on various parts of the chart.
- To download the attendance report that you've now customized, all you have to do is click on the little cloud icon on the top right corner of the Attendance section.

And just like that, your attendance report is downloaded as a local copy.
