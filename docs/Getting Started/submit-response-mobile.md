### How To Submit Responses From Your Mobile

Okay, you've got your field team on the Fieldproxy app, and they have the credentials to log in and start recording field data. What's next? Recording the data of course?

Here's a step by step guide on how to record data from your phone as a field agent:

- **[Download the Fieldproxy app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldproxy.agent)** in case you haven't yet.
- Log in to the app using the credentials provided by your manager. If you have not received these details, we advise connecting with them to get the appropriate permissions and login details first.
- Choose the task that you need to get done. For instance, if it's for tracking attendance, click on the Attendance option.
- Click on the Check In task and fill in your details.
- Click on Submit.

Voila! Your manager can see your real time data on their dashboard everytime you make an entry. It's as simple as that.

If you have any difficulties while performing a task or if you need any further assistance, we would love to help you out. Just **[write to us here](mailto:support@fieldproxy.com)**.
