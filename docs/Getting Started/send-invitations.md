## Inviting Members To Fieldproxy

Once you've **[added your teammates](http://docs.fieldproxy.com/docs/Getting%20Started/upload-users/)**, the next step is to send them an invitation to be able to access the application.

Don't worry, we've kept this one simple as well. Just follow the steps below and you'll be all set:

- On the **[Teams](https://attendance.fieldproxy.com/attendanceproxy/home/team)** page - after importing or adding your employees.
- Click on the "**Invite User**" button and an automated SMS will be sent to each new member with a link to access your team's application.
- Alternatively, you can also click on the "**Send Invitation**" button next to the individual team member to send them links to the application selectively.

Once your teammates click on the link, they should be able to access the application by entering their respective login credentials.

If you're facing any issues with inviting members, do **[write to us here](mailto:support@fieldproxy.com)**, and our team will reach out to you as soon as possible.
