### Views In Dashboard

Once you've logged in to **[Fieldproxy](https://client.fieldproxy.com/)**, the first page that pops up is the manager dashboard. We've made it as efficient and streamlined as possible for you to work on it, to view data, and manage basically anything - all from one interactive space.

The dashboard holds a lot of information, so if you ever get lost, here's a helpful guide on what each section of the board does, and how you can make the best use of it.

#### Chart View

The chart view holds employee-recorded data in a more presentable, visually interactive format. You have charts to show interactive charts to display attendance and track timings in a manner that makes sense, leave requests that need to be managed, and the expenses recorded by the employees - all in real-time.

Let's take a look at each of these sections:

##### Attendance

The attendance section is literally what it claims to be - it shows whether a particular employee has checked in or not. There are actually two ways you can keep track of an employee's attendance information.

- Click on the "**Attendance**" tab and filter data using the interactive chart.
- Click on the "**Timing**" tab and use the same filtering method to search for the check in time of the employees. This is mostly used to check on late logins and repeated defaults.

##### Leave Requests

Any request made by an employee of your team pops up in this section. You can always accept or reject leave requests from the dashboard itself - there's no need to go into needless form filling - just a simple click will do the job.

##### Expenses

Anything and everything that your employees charge as an expense gets recorded on this section of the dashboard. It may be fuel, food, or just travel charges. You can even see a cumulative total of the expenses of the entire day in this section

#### Data Dump View

Now, everything you see on the chart view is only the data for the present day. You can check this by looking at the date mentioned on the top right corner of the page.

What if you wanted to see yesterday's data? Or the day before. Or data from the past ten days? That's when you switch to the Data Dump view.

Here, you can simply select the date range from the **top right corner of each section**, and choose the duration for which you need the data. It's the same for every section on the dashboard, so it's very simple to get your teammates' data at anytime, anywhere.

Oh, and you can download any section data by clicking on the little cloud icon on the sections.

So there you have it - the Fieldproxy dashboard, made simple. If you have any difficulties with the dashboard, you can always **[write to us here](mailto:support@fieldproxy.com)**, and our team will reach out to you as soon as possible.
